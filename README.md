# Rusty-Lox

A Rust implementation of a Tree-Walk interpreter for the Lox programming language. The Lox programming language is defined and described in the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

This is my first true Rust project and thus is probably pretty bad. I tried to stay true to the Java interpreter implemnted in the excellent Crafting Interpreters book, probably to a fault (and by that I mean not utilizing some of Rust's unique features). The general structure is that I will create branches for each Chapter in order to give a more direct interpretation of my progress (as I will likely commit often within chapters). The main branch is the most up-to-date version.
