# Rusty-Lox

A Rust implementation of a Tree-Walk interpreter for the Lox programming language. The Lox programming language is defined and described in the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

This is my first true Rust project and thus is probably pretty bad. I tried to stay true to the Java interpreter implemented in the excellent Crafting Interpreters book where I could. As I learn more idiomatic Rust I will update and note here.
